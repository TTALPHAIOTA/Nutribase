*As of right now the file has the default react template that comes with creating a default react application*

*When coding please make your own branch where you then push and fix any merge issues, I also RECOMMEND downloading "ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets" extension for more efficient coding with react. EX: use rfc to create the header right away, and etc*

## Creating the Project

### Go to client for front end, in 'components' folder this is where you create components using react, such as navbar, login button, and etc.
### Go to client for front end, in 'pages' folder this where you create .css files and .jsx files.
